2. Build and run the app on an emulator or a physical device.

## 🎉 Features
This app includes the following features:

- ViewPager2 for swiping between screens
- Navigation Component for managing the flow between screens
- Shared Preferences for storing whether the Onboarding Screens have been shown before

## 📱 Usage
To use this app, follow these steps:

1. When the app is launched for the first time, the Onboarding Screens will be shown.
2. Swipe left or right to navigate between the screens.
3. Tap the "Get Started" button on the last screen to finish the Onboarding Screens.
4. The next time the app is launched, the Onboarding Screens will not be shown.
